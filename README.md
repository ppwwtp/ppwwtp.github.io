# Overview - Wastewater Treatment Practice Questions
Wastewater operators are required to pass tests in order to get their operators license. Practice tests on paper are cumbersome, time consuming, and do not reflect the actual test taking process. This page uses questions from the practice tests to give operators an easier way to prepare for their upcoming test. 

This project was implemented in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The JavaScript could use some work to make it more modular (especially the checkAnswer function!).

Using this project is relatively simple - open the page in a web browser, read the question and click the button that corresponds with the correct answer. Your score will be calculated at the top. You are encouraged to check answers until you find the correct one.

## Future Updates
1. Add more questions
2. Modularize the JavaScript
3. Add explanations of the answer to the popup box when the correct answer is selected
4. Update CSS to be cleaner and more organized
5. Optimize for mobile
